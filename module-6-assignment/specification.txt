First, you will debug the Paint1 class so that no errors remain and all 
calculations work correctly by completing the following:
    - Find and fix the three errors in the given code.
    - Use the following sample input values to test your program:
        Input:
            30
            25
        Output: 
            Wall area: 750.0 square feet
            Paint needed: 2.142857142857143 gallons

    If you have found and fixed all the errors, your output should exactly match the sample.

Next, you will add loops to validate all user input and handle exceptions so that code 
passes all test cases by completing the following:
    - Review the code, looking for the two code blocks where user input is required.
    - Implement a do-while loop in both blocks of code to ensure that input is valid 
      and any exceptions are handled.
    - Use the two following sample sets of input to test your program. Since these 
      inputs are invalid, your program should respond to each by prompting the user 
      to enter valid input. This should continue to loop until valid input is received.

The first sample invalid inputs are the spelled-out number thirty and the numeral 25. 
The second sample invalid inputs are the numerals 30 and 0.

Think: Why is 0 invalid input for this problem? What is the user being asked to input?
