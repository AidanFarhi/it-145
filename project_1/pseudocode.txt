Good job on your pseudocode. Overall, the pseudocode is very clear and concise. 
The pseudocode also addressed most of the specifications of the check in method. 
However, it doesn't account for the differences between collecting the appropriate 
information for a new pet and updating information for returning pets. Good job on this overall though.

method checkInPet() {
    CALL getCheckInInfoFromClient()
    CALL checkBoardingSpace(pet)
    IF there is no boarding space
        PRINT 'Sorry, there is not enough room for your pet'
        RETURN false
    END IF
    CALL assignPetSpace(pet)
    RETURN true
}

method getCheckInInfoFromClient() {
    GET pet, length of stay, and grooming preference info from the client
    IF the owner wants the pet to be groomed
        IF the pet is a cat
            PRINT 'Sorry, only dogs can be groomed'
        ELSE IF the pet is a dog and the length of stay is less than two days
            PRINT 'Sorry, the length of stay must be at least two days for grooming'
            CALL pet.setGrooming(false)
        ELSE
            CALL pet.setGrooming(true)
        END IF
    END IF
    RETURN a new Pet object with all of the collected info
}

method checkBoardingSpace(Pet pet) {
    IF the type of pet is a dog
        IF there are not enough spaces for dogs
            RETURN false
        END IF
    ELSE 
        IF there are not enough spaces for cats
            RETURN false
        END IF
    END IF
    RETURN true
}

method assignPetSpace(Pet pet) {
    IF the type of pet is a dog
        GET an available dog space
        CALL pet.setDogSpaceNumber(available space)
        SET dog space as occupied
    ELSE
        GET an available cat space
        CALL pet.setCatSpaceNumber(available space)
        SET cat space as occupied
    END IF
}
